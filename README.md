# gpt-nq-prompt-generator
This is an exploratory project into machine learning by initially training a GPT-2 model (gpt2-medium) on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset to grasp question-answering mechanisms. Post this foundational training, the model underwent fine-tuning to pivot its capabilities towards generating job title prompts using prompt examples created by 'text-davinci-002' and further augmented with source and target noise. Used PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers api. The model is published at on Hugging Face: [sgarbi/gpt-nq-prompt-generator](https://huggingface.co/sgarbi/gpt-nq-prompt-generator).
